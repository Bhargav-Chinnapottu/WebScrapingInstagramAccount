Problem: ['Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged. Note: use .equals() to compare 2 strings.'] 
Example: notString("candy") → "not candy" 
Example: notString("x") → "not x" 
Example: notString("not bad") → "not bad"
